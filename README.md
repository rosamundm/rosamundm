## 🌹 Hello, my name is Rosamund 🌹
### I'm a developer working with:

 - Python, especially Django 🐍
 - JavaScript ☕️

### 🖋 Fun fact: I have a solid background in writing, editing, and translation from my previous career. In 2019, I decided to commit to learning to code and switch to working in software development.
Making technical knowledge clear, accessible, and enjoyable to all is a passion of mine, as you can see on my [blog](https://rosamund.dev)!

### 💻  Here are a few of my recent personal projects:
* API for Berlin streets named after historical women, built with Django REST Framework ([repo](https://github.com/rosamundm/womens-history-of-berlin--api))
* a frontend application accompanying this, built with React ([repo](https://github.com/rosamundm/womens-history-of-berlin--frontend) | [project](https://womens-history-of-berlin.netlify.app/))
* tech blog, built with Next.js (repo available upon request | [project](https://www.rosamund.dev/))
* app showing my personal recommendations for vegan places in Berlin according to different criteria, built with TypeScript and React ([repo](https://github.com/rosamundm/vegan-finder) | [project](https://berlin-vegan-finder.netlify.app/))

### 🗣 I have an active working knowledge of both English and German.
Feel free to talk to me in French, too!

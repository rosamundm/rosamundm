## Hello, my name is Rosamund!

* I'm a developer and writer. Day-to-day, I currently work with Python/Django and TypeScript/React.
* You can read more about me and what makes me tick on [my website](https://rosamundmather.com/).

### Here are a few of my recent personal web projects:
* API for Berlin streets named after historical women, built with Django REST Framework ([repo](https://github.com/rosamundm/womens-history-of-berlin--api))
* a frontend application accompanying this, built with React ([repo](https://github.com/rosamundm/womens-history-of-berlin--frontend) | [project](https://womens-history-of-berlin.netlify.app/))
* tech blog documenting my developer journey + more, built with Next.js (repo available upon request | [project](https://www.rosamund.dev/))
* app showing my personal recommendations for vegan places in Berlin, built with TypeScript and React ([repo](https://github.com/rosamundm/vegan-finder) | [project](https://berlin-vegan-finder.netlify.app/))

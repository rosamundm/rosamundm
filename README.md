## 🌹 Hello, my name is Rosamund (she/her) 🌹
### I'm a developer working with:

 - Python & Django (primarily) 🐍
 - JavaScript & its various ecosystems (sometimes) ☕️

### 🖋 Fun fact: I have a solid background in writing, editing, and translation from my previous career. I decided to switch to software development in 2019.
Making technical knowledge clear, accessible, and enjoyable to all is a passion of mine, as you can see on my [blog](https://rosamund.dev)!

### 🗣 I have an active working knowledge of both English and German.
Feel free to talk to me in French, too!

### 💻  Here are a couple of my recent projects (some repositories are private for security reasons — I can show them upon request):
* tech blog, built with Next.js
* API for Berlin streets named after historical women, built with Django REST Framework
* a frontend application accompanying this, built with React
